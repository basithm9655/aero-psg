## How Roll Numbers Work

PSG Tech roll numbers follow this format: `[Year][Dept Code][Number]`

**Examples:**
- `23S042` → 2023 batch, B.Sc. Applied Science, student #42
- `24Z105` → 2024 batch, CSE, student #105
- `22M220` → 2022 batch, Mechanical Engineering, student #220

The system auto-detects department from the roll number's middle letter(s).
